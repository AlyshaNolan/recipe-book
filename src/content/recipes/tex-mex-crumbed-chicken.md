1. Cut potato into large chunks and cook in boiling water, over high heat, until easily pierced with a fork, 12-15 minutes. Once cooked drain and return the saucepan to medium-high heat, add the butter and cook, stirring, until fragrant, roughly 1 minute. Add the chicken-style stock powder. Stir to combine, then remove from heat. Add the corn and lightly crush with a fork. Cover to keep warm.

2. Meanwhile, prepare chicken by cutting breats in half horizontally (so you have thin steaks)

3. Add flour to a shallow bowl. In a second shallow bowl, whisk the egg. In a third shallow bowl, combine panko breadcrumbs and Tex-Mex spice blend. Coat chicken first in the flour, followed by the egg and finally the breadcrumb mixture.

4. Cook chicken in an air fryer at 200Â°C turning halfway, until golden and cooked through (when no longer pink inside), 12-15 minutes.

    > No air fryer? Heat a large frying pan over medium-high with enough olive oil to coat the base. Cook crumbed chicken in batches until golden and cooked through, 3-5 minutes each side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.

5. In a medium bowl, combine red cabbage, green cabbage, carrot and mayonnaise to make the slaw.
